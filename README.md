# luckfox-gpio
This little program is supposed to work on a small embedded linux platform such as the LuckFox Pico. You can control and read the GPIOs. The control is either on the web interface (Port 80) or via SCPI commands via port 5025.

## BNC-control
originally, it is to control a coaxial switch to e.g. switch signals on an experiment between different data acquisition options, such as between a LockIn-amplifier and an oscilloscope.
