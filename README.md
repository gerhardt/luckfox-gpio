# luckfox-gpio
This little program is supposed to work on a small embedded linux platform such as the LuckFox Pico. You can control and read the GPIOs.

## BNC-control
originally, it is to control a coaxial switch to e.g. switch signals on an experiment between different data acquisition options, such as between a LockIn-amplifier and an oscilloscope.
